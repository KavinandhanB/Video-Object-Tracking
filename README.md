# Video-Object-Tracking
Object tracking refers to the ability to estimate or predict the position of a target object in each consecutive frame in a video once the initial position of the target object is defined. In other words, it is the task of estimating or predicting the positions and other relevant information of moving objects in a video.   
Object tracking usually involves the process of object detection. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the steps:  
Object detection, where the algorithm classifies and detects the object by creating a bounding box around it.  
Assigning unique identification for each object (ID).  
Tracking the detected object as it moves through frames while storing the relevant information.
